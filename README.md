# Mono Patcher 0.2.2

Mono Patcher is a library created for Sims 3 mod development. It allows you to replace game behaviors/methods at runtime, without needing to create core mods, which involves overriding whole game assemblies, creating conflicts.

## Usage
Check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/LazyDuchess/MonoPatcher/wiki) to learn how to integrate Mono Patcher into your Sims 3 script mods.

Also check out the [SamplePatches](https://github.com/LazyDuchess/MonoPatcher/tree/main/Samples/SamplePatches) folder for an example.
